## Notes

SORAN represents the first step in CORELAI SECTOR's extra-terrestrial expansion.

Terraformation and infrastructural development will proceed under Roadmap001.

All operations are subject to UEG Colonial Regulation Standard-54.1 and sector-specific governance protocols.

Further reports will be generated as each Division activates its operational module on SORAN.
